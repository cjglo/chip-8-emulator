# Chip-8 Emulator
CHIP-8 Emulator (technically interpreter) built with no source on software design of CHIP-8.  Only source was Tobias V. Langhoff's article on what each hardware part is and the specifications so that people can design CHIP-8 on thier own.

## Installation and Running

The Chip-8 currently is under progress and only has a few commands implemented, however these are enough to run small programs like the IBM Logo Program.  This program runs by default (in the future this will except command line inputs for programs).   

To insall and run this emulator: clone the repo and run these in the root directory
```
make build
make run
```

## Dependencies

raylib 4.2.0
clang++ 15.0.0
